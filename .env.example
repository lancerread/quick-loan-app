# PayHero Payment Integration Configuration
# DO NOT commit this file with real values to version control
#
# For development on Replit, use the Replit Secrets tab instead of .env
# This keeps credentials secure and separate from your code
#
# How to set up:
# 1. Get credentials from your PayHero dashboard
# 2. Add them as Secrets in Replit (Secrets tab on left sidebar)
# 3. The application will automatically read them

# PayHero API Endpoint
# Default for M-Pesa payments
PAYHERO_API_URL=https://backend.payhero.co.ke/api/v2/payments

# Your PayHero API Credentials
# Option A (if you have API Username and Password):
#   - Combine as: username:password
#   - Base64 encode it
#   - Prepend "Basic "
# Option B (if PayHero provided you a Basic Auth Token):
#   - Use it directly
PAYHERO_BASIC_AUTH=Basic YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_TOKEN

# Your PayHero Account ID (provided in dashboard)
# This is your Channel ID in PayHero
PAYHERO_CHANNEL_ID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID

# M-Pesa Network Code
# 63902 = Safaricom (most common)
PAYHERO_NETWORK_CODE=63902

# Webhook Callback URL (optional for MVP)
# When PayHero completes a payment, it sends confirmation to this URL
# 
# For development/MVP:
#   - Can be a placeholder initially: https://your-app.replit.dev/api/webhook
#   - Update once deployed: https://your-production-domain.com/api/webhook
#
# Note: You do NOT need a database to handle webhooks
#   - Your server can receive the webhook, validate it, and update in-memory
#   - Later you can add database persistence
PAYHERO_CALLBACK_URL=https://your-app-domain.com/api/webhook/payhero
